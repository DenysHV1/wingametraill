        <p>
          This privacy policy applies to the Merge Cruise: Mystery Puzzle app
          (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was
          created by (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free

        </p>
        <h2 class="info-page_title">Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>

            your visit, the time spent on those pages
          </li>
          <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
          <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="special-p-margin">
          The Application does not gather precise information about the location
          of your mobile device.
        </p>

          request will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy
          policy.
        </p>
        <h2 class="info-page_title">Third Party Access</h2>

          Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to

          privacy statement.
